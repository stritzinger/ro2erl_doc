# ROS2 Enhanced Reliability Layer (Target-X)

## Project Purpose
Target-X enables secure and reliable ROS2/DDS communication across distributed robotic systems, optimizing performance for challenging network conditions like low bandwidth, high latency, and intermittent connectivity.

## At a Glance

- **Problem**: ROS2/DDS systems struggle with wide-area networks, bandwidth constraints, and security challenges 
- **Solution**: Bridge-hub architecture with intelligent traffic management
- **Benefits**: Extended operational range, network resilience, and simplified multi-site management
- **Implementation**: Two independent Erlang applications handling local and cloud-side operations
